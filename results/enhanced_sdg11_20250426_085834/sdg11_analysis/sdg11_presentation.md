# Enhanced Traffic Control for SDG 11

## Executive Summary

### Slide 1: Project Overview

- **Title**: Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Traffic Control
- **SDG 11 Focus**: Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
- **Approach**: Multi-objective reinforcement learning with prioritized experience replay
- **Testing**: Extensive simulations across varying traffic conditions

### Slide 2: Key Enhancements

- **Environmental**: Multi-pollutant approach (CO2, NOx, PM, noise)
- **Inclusivity**: Pedestrian waiting times and transit priority
- **Safety**: Accident risk reduction through smooth traffic flow
- **Resilience**: Adaptive policies for incidents and weather conditions

### Slide 3: Key Results

- *Results graphics would be shown here*

### Slide 4: SDG 11 Contributions

- **Target 11.2**: Sustainable transport through balanced, inclusive traffic management
- **Target 11.6**: Air quality improvement via emission-aware control strategies
- **Target 11.B**: Urban resilience with adaptive responses to varying conditions

### Slide 5: Future Directions

- **Network expansion**: Coordinate multiple intersections
- **Deeper equity**: Account for neighborhood characteristics
- **Mode integration**: Explicit modeling of bicycles and micromobility
- **Real-time adaptation**: Connect to air quality and weather sensors
