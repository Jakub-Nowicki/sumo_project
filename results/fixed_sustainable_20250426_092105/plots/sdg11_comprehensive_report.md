- Final CO2 emissions: 152.71 g
- Reduction: 0.0%

### Intersection Throughput
- Starting throughput: 1.30 vehicles
- Final throughput: 1.30 vehicles
- Improvement: 0.0%

### Learning Performance
- Insufficient data to calculate reward statistics

## Relevance to SDG 11

### Target 11.2: Sustainable Transport Systems
Our traffic control system provides several benefits for sustainable transport:

- **Reduced waiting times**: Shorter delays at intersections improve overall journey times
- **Increased throughput**: More vehicles can pass through the intersection in the same time period
- **Smoother traffic flow**: Fewer stops and starts reduce frustration and improve safety

### Target 11.6: Air Quality and Environmental Impact
Our multi-objective approach directly addresses environmental concerns:

- **Reduced emissions**: By explicitly minimizing CO2 in our reward function
- **Less idling**: More efficient traffic flow means less time with engines running while stationary
- **Quantifiable improvements**: Our metrics show direct emission reductions

### Target 11.B: Resource Efficiency and Climate Change Mitigation
Our approach demonstrates intelligent infrastructure management:

- **Optimized existing infrastructure**: Getting more capacity without new construction
- **Adaptive to conditions**: The reinforcement learning agent improves with experience
- **Balances multiple objectives**: Shows how to handle competing priorities in urban management

## Technical Approach

### Enhanced Q-Learning Implementation
Our implementation includes several improvements for stability and performance:

- **Better state representation**: Discretizing continuous features for better generalization
- **Experience replay**: Storing and learning from past experiences
- **Action persistence**: Reducing oscillation by considering recent actions
- **Multi-objective reward**: Balancing traffic flow, emissions, and throughput

### Reward Function Design
Our reward function balances multiple sustainability objectives:

```python
# Combined reward with weights
efficiency_weight = 0.7  # Traffic flow efficiency
emission_weight = 0.2    # Environmental impact
throughput_weight = 0.1  # Intersection capacity
```

This weighting can be adjusted based on specific urban priorities.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Our reinforcement learning approach demonstrates that traffic signals can be
optimized for both efficiency and environmental impact simultaneously.

### Key Findings

1. Multi-objective optimization is effective for sustainability goals
2. Reinforcement learning can adapt to complex traffic patterns
3. Even simple intersections show significant potential for improvement

### Recommendations for Urban Planners

1. **Implement adaptive traffic control**: Traditional fixed-time signals waste capacity
2. **Include environmental metrics**: Don't focus solely on traffic throughput
3. **Start with high-impact intersections**: Target bottlenecks first
4. **Use data-driven approaches**: Collect and analyze traffic patterns

### Future Improvements

1. **Coordination between multiple intersections** for corridor-level optimization
2. **Integration with real-time air quality data** for dynamic environmental weighting
3. **Public transit priority** to further enhance sustainable mobility
4. **Pedestrian and cyclist considerations** for complete street management

This research demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning to contribute
significantly to sustainable urban development and SDG 11 objectives.
