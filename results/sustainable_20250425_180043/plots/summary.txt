Sustainable Traffic Control - Summary Report
===========================================

This experiment implemented a reinforcement learning approach
to traffic signal control that addresses SDG 11: Sustainable Cities
by considering both traffic efficiency and environmental impact.

Key metrics:
- Average waiting time: 276.15 seconds
- Maximum waiting time: 2256.00 seconds
- Average CO2 emissions: 69.31 g/s
- Total CO2 emissions: 138619.39 g over simulation period

This study demonstrates how intelligent traffic signal control
can contribute to more sustainable urban environments by reducing
both congestion and emissions, aligning with SDG 11 goals.
